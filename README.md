# Open-set Mosquito Classification on Crowdsourced data using two-stage system with OpenMax

This is the code repository for the paper "...". It is largely inspired from the 7th place solution for the MosquitoAlert Challenge 2023 by HCA97. Link to the original [here](https://github.com/HCA97/Mosquito-Classifiction/tree/main).


## Train CLIP Classifier

1. **Install Datasets**
   - Download the competition dataset from [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/mosquitoalert-challenge-2023/dataset_files) and unzip it to a folder named `data_round_2` (the annotations files are included).
   - Install GBIF [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lekoup/gbif-residual-cropped) and unzip it to `gbif-cropped` folder (the annotations file is included).

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Use the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Run the Classifier**
   - Navigate to the `experiments` directory and run `train_clip.ipynb`.

## How to Train YOLOv8-s Model

1. **Install Competition Dataset**
   - Download the competition dataset from [here](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/mosquitoalert-challenge-2023/dataset_files) and unzip it to a folder named `data_round_2`.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Use the following command to install the necessary dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Prepare YOLO Dataset**
   - Navigate to the `experiments/yolo` directory and run the script: `python convert_mosquito_to_yolo.py`.

4. **Start Training**
   - Execute the command: `python yolo_training.py`.

## YOLO + CLIP with OpenMax
   - Navigate to `experiments` folder for experimentations.
   - Insert weights path of YOLO and CLIP into and run `yoloclip.ipynb` to run pipeline with OpenMax.
   - To compare YOLO with YOLO + CLIP pipeline, use `yolo_vs_yoloClip.ipynb`.


## Annotation Files

### data_round_2

- `phase2_train_v0_cleaned.csv` was created using `owl-vit`. You can refer to `experiments/cleaning_annotations.ipynb` for details.
- `phase2_train_v0_cleaned_yolo_best_annotations.csv` uses `phase2_train_v0_cleaned.csv` along with YOLOv8-s model annotations. Refer to `extra_data/annotate_images_yolo.py` for more information.
- `best_model_val_data_yolo_annotations.csv` and `best_model_train_data_yolo_annotations.csv` are train/validation splits of `phase2_train_v0_cleaned_yolo_best_annotations.csv`.

### gbif-cropped and inaturalist-six-cropped

- `inaturalist.csv` contains annotations for lux's dataset. Since the images are already cropped, we used the entire image as the bounding box.
- `ma_lux1.csv` is a combination of the mosquito alert's annotation and the GBIF `inaturalist.csv` annotation, which is the main annotation to deal with
